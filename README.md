# APIStudies

This Project is a study on how to implemented API funactions to Unreal engine 5. 
The tools used in this Project: nodejs, rest api, ue5, va Rest and Widgets.

I made a local server trough nodejs with a code for a todo list and with the help of va Rest plugin for the Unreal Engine I implementet its api to the engine and made a code with blueprints and widgets to show the todo list ingame with the ability to add new todos to the list and chaning already existing ones.

Example:
